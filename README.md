# ELMO Version 0.1.3
Welcome to the Endogenous Latent Moderator (ELMO) Variance Calculator.

To run ELMO locally, open Rstudio or an R console and paste/run the following code: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
runGitHub("ELMO", "mbfrisby", ref = "main")
```

If you do not have the shiny library installed, you may need to first run the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("shiny")
```
